# SQL Portfolio

Welcome to my SQL portfolio repository! Here, you‚Äôll find a selection of SQL projects and queries that highlight my programming skills and analytical capabilities. These projects, completed as part of my learning journey on DataCamp, demonstrate my ability to work with data, create complex queries, and extract meaningful insights.

## üìä SQL Projects

### 1. **Wholesale Revenue Analysis for Motorcycle Parts Company**
   - **Objective:** Analyze sales data to calculate net revenue by product line, grouped by month and warehouse, focusing solely on wholesale orders. This analysis provided insights into revenue trends across different warehouses and product lines over time.

### 2. **Analysis of International Debt Data**
   - **Objective:** Explore debt data from The World Bank, identifying the number of distinct countries, the country with the highest total debt, and the country with the lowest repayments. The analysis offered insights into global debt distribution and repayment patterns among developing nations.

### 3. **EV Charging Station Usage Analysis for Apartment Buildings**
   - **Objective:** Analyze EV charging habits in apartment buildings to help building managers understand patterns in charging station usage, including session duration, electricity consumption, and peak usage times. This analysis provided valuable insights for optimizing shared charging station availability.

### 4. **Analysis of Product Carbon Footprints Across Industries**
   - **Objective:** Examine product carbon footprints (PCFs) across various industries, focusing on greenhouse gas emissions during different stages of product production. This analysis identified key sectors contributing to global emissions and suggested opportunities for reducing environmental impact.

### 5. **Exploring the Golden Age of Video Games**
   - **Objective:** Analyze video game critic and user scores, along with sales data, to identify the "golden age" of video games. The project also explored the business side of gaming by examining sales data, using dataset joins, set theory comparisons, filtering, and grouping.

### 6. **Analyzing Mental Health Risks Among International Students**
   - **Objective:** Investigate data from a Japanese international university‚Äôs 2018 student survey to assess the mental health risks of international students. The analysis focused on the relationship between social connectedness, acculturative stress, and depression, while also considering the impact of the length of stay.
